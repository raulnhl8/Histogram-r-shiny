# Histogram-r-shiny
 
That is a simple application created with shiny R package. 

For more information about this package click on the link: https://shiny.rstudio.com/

In this application you can enter the text in the <b>Text input</b> field. Or read the text from a txt file, to be selected in the <b>File input</b> field.

The <b>Select box</b> is use to choose between reading the text from the file or from the input box.

Any suggestions, please let me know :D
